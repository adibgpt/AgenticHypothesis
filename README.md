## Methodologies
The repository includes a diverse set of methodologies, frameworks, and tools employed across the reviewed papers:

### 1. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs)
- **Approach**: Contrasting multi-source temporal knowledge graphs to capture the dynamic evolution of relationships in biomedical datasets.
- **Example**: Temporal Contrastive Learning (TCL) framework for generating high-quality hypotheses by modeling co-evolution across datasets like PubMed and CTD.

### 2. Transformer-Based Models
- **AGATHA Framework**:
  - Utilizes transformer models for biomedical literature mining.
  - Validates hypotheses using temporal holdout datasets.
- **HYVIN Framework**:
  - Combines hypothesis, verification, and induction stages for skill learning in LLM-based agents.

### 3. Graph-Based and Multi-Agent Frameworks
- **MOOSE-CHEM**:
  - A multi-agent system for rediscovering unseen chemistry hypotheses through inspiration-based recombination and ranking mechanisms.

### 4. Statistical and Meta-Analytical Approaches
- **Meta-Analysis Automation**:
  - Utilizing decomposed zero-shot prompting for data extraction.
  - Formulating and solving optimization problems for hypothesis validation.

### 5. Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning
- **FitRepair Framework**:
  - Explores the plastic surgery hypothesis in automated program repair (APR).
  - Employs domain-specific fine-tuning strategies like knowledge-intensive and repair-oriented approaches.

## Applications
The repository covers applications of hypothesis generation in several domains:

### Biomedical Research
- **Temporal Evolution Analysis**: Identifying latent associations in biomedical data using graph-based methods.
- **Gene-Disease Studies**: Linking chemical, gene, and disease data for new discoveries.

### Materials Science
- **Perovskite Solar Cells**:
  - ChatGPT-generated hypotheses suggested novel surface modifiers like polyallylamine.
  - Experimental validation confirmed efficiency improvements.

### Social Sciences
- **Hypothesis Evidencing**:
  - Evaluating LLMs' ability to discern evidence supporting or refuting scientific hypotheses.
  - Developed datasets for benchmarking evidencing capabilities.

### Chemistry
- **Rediscovering Hypotheses**:
  - MOOSE-CHEM framework recreated hypotheses in high-impact publications.
  - Inspired methodologies to address research questions using multi-source inspirations.

## Challenges and Opportunities
### Challenges
- **Bias and Validity**:
  - Addressing biases inherent in LLMs' training datasets.
  - Ensuring hypotheses generated are novel, valid, and actionable.
- **Computational Costs**:
  - High resource demands for fine-tuning and large-scale evaluations.

### Opportunities
- **Interdisciplinary Research**:
  - Integrating LLMs into cross-domain studies to foster innovation.
- **Automation of Research Workflows**:
  - Streamlining data synthesis, hypothesis formulation, and experiment planning.
